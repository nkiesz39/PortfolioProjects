# Welcome to my Sandbox!

This repository is a collection of some of my short-term projects, professional work, and learning experiments that didn't have a dedicated home elsewhere. Dive in to discover a mix of passion projects, problem-solving challenges, and innovative ideas. 

## Repo Structure
Each individual project has its own file or folder. 

## Project Showcase

### [Python Stock Data Analysis](https://github.com/nkiesz39/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Python_Historical_Stock_Data_Analysis.ipynb)
This Project was undertaken as part of my journey towards completing the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certification. It was completed during the 'Python for Data Science' course on Coursera. DUring this time, I had the opportunity to apply my data analysis skills on real-world data and scenarios.
#### Project Goals
The main goal of the project was to extract and visualize stock data using several techniques. To achieve this, I used the follow methods:

1. **Data Collection** : I used the yfinance library available in Python to gather historical data of both Tesla and GameStop stock from Yahoo Finance. In addition , I employed webscraping techniques to collect more data related to these two stocks.
2. **Data Visualization** : After gathering the necessary data, a custom make_graph function was created using plotly.graph_objects and make_subplots from plotly.subplots to visualize the stock data effectively.
   
#### Technology, Skills, and Libraries used:
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Python
- pandas
- yfinance
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
- Webscraping

This project represents a key milestone in my data analysis journey, demonstrating my ability to acquire, manipulate, and visualize financial data, all while applying a range of important data analysis skills and utilizing various Python libraries.

### [Chicago Data Analysis Using SQLite and Python](https://github.com/nkiesz39/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/SQL_Python_Chicago_Analysis.ipynb)
This project was undertaken as a component of my pursuit of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate through Coursera. It was executed during the "Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python" course. During this course, I had the opportunity to use IBM's DB2 as well as Jupyter Notebooks. This project was completed in a Jupyter Notebook file. The main focus of the course was the world of relational databases and the utilization of SQL for data manipulation and analysis
#### Project Goals
The main goal of this project was to collect data from several sources related to Chicago, including Census Data, Crime Data, and Public School Data, and load them into a SQLite database where they could be queried and analyzed. This was achieved through a multi-step process, involving the creation of a connection to a new SQLite database and the loading of each downloaded CSV file as a separate table within the database. SQL magic commands were employed directly within the notebook to interact with the database and extract valuable information, thus enabling me to answer specific questions about the datasets.

#### Technology, Skills, and Libraries used:
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Python
- sqlite3
- SQL Magic Commands
- pandas

This project showcases my ability, as a data analyst,  to gather, organize, and query data from diverse sources, using SQL as a powerful tool for data exploration. The project also highlights my proficiency in Python, SQL, and Jupyter Notebook as essential components of my data analysis toolkit.

### [COVID SQL Data Exploration](https://github.com/nkiesz39/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/COVID%20Project%20Scripts.sql)

This project utilizes SQL for Data Exploration of Covid-19 Data
